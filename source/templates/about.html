    <h2>About</h2>
        This project was developed as a semestral assignment for the BI-VMW subject at the FIT CTU.

    <h2>Algorithms</h2>
        <h3>query function</h3>
            Query functions return the elements from my database.
            <h4>naive algorithm</h4>
                <li>Compute overall score for every object by looking into each sorted list.</li>
                <li>Return k objects with the highest overall score.</li>
            <h4>fagin's algorithm</h4>
                 <li>Sequentially access all the sorted lists in parallel until there are k objects that have been
                     seen in all lists.</li>
                <li>Perform random accesses to obtain the scores of all seen objects</li>
                <li>Compute score for all objects and return the top-k</li>
            <h4>top-k treshold</h4>
                <li>Set the threshold t to be the aggregate of the scores seen in this access.</li>
                <li>Do random accesses and compute the scores of the seen objects.</li>
                <li>Maintain a list of top-k objects seen so far.</li>
                <li>Stop, when the scores of the top-k are greater or equal to the threshold.</li>
                <li>Return the top-k seen so far.</li>
        <h3>aggregation function</h3>
            I have implemented 2 functions to get the best items based on the parameters selected by the checkbox.
            <h4>sum</h4>
                This function sums all the selected parameters.
            <h4>max</h4>
                This function selects the highest value among selected parameters. This is the same as doing average of the
                elements since the ratings are normalised.
        <h3>Speed comparison</h3>
            These are the results on the dataset containing about 7000 elements. The y axis represents query time and the x axis
            the size of the query. The <b>top-k</b> algorithm is faster for the query of the size lower than the half of the dataset.
            <b>Fagin's</b> algorithm outperforms the top-k on the dataset presented.
            The <b>naive</b> algorithm just sorts the array so when querying more than half of the database it outperforms the
            top-k algorithm that starts to work like a heap sort but with added overhang. The test was run with a sum function
            using all 3 parameters.
            <h4>Comparison of diferent datasets using the sum aggregate function</h4>

    <h2>Structure</h2>
        The data is stored in 3 arrays each containing a KeyValue pair (car, value).
        Each array is sorted when the server starts or when the dataset is loaded.
